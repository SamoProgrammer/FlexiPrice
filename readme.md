## Usage

To get started with **FlexiPriceEngine**, follow these steps to set up the pricing engine and apply various discount strategies:

### Step 1: Create the Pricing Engine
Initialize the pricing engine and add the discount strategies you want to apply.

```csharp
var pricingEngine = new PricingEngine();
pricingEngine.AddDiscountService(new LoyaltyDiscountStrategy());
pricingEngine.AddDiscountService(new StockLevelDiscountStrategy());
pricingEngine.AddDiscountService(new PurchaseHistoryDiscountStrategy(orderService));
```

### Step 2: Calculate the Final Price
Use the `CalculateFinalPrice` method to compute the final price of a product for a customer.

```csharp
var customer = new Customer { LoyaltyTier = "Gold", Region = "US" };
var product = new Product { BasePrice = 1000 };

var finalPrice = pricingEngine.CalculateFinalPrice(customer, product);

Console.WriteLine($"Final Price: {finalPrice}");
```

### 2. **Geographic Location-Based Pricing**
Offer region-specific discounts based on the customer's geographic location.

```csharp
pricingEngine.AddDiscountService(new RegionalPricingStrategy());

## Extending FlexiPriceEngine

**FlexiPriceEngine** is designed to be modular and extensible. You can add new services, discount strategies, or custom logic by implementing the `IDiscountService` interface.

### Step 1: Create a Custom Discount Strategy

To add a custom discount strategy, implement the `IDiscountService` interface.

```csharp
public class SeasonalDiscountStrategy : IDiscountService
{
    public Discount CalculateDiscount(Customer customer, Product product)
    {
        var discount = new Discount { Percentage = 0 };

        if (DateTime.Now.Month == 12) // Apply discount during December
        {
            discount.Percentage = 15;
            discount.Description = "Holiday Discount";
        }

        return discount;
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Register the Custom Strategy
After creating a custom strategy, register it in the pricing engine.

```csharp
pricingEngine.AddDiscountService(new SeasonalDiscountStrategy());
```
