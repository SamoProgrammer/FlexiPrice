csharp
Copy code
public class SeasonalDiscountStrategy : IDiscountService
{
    public Discount CalculateDiscount(Customer customer, Product product)
    {
        var discount = new Discount { Percentage = 0 };

        if (DateTime.Now.Month == 12) // Apply discount during December
        {
            discount.Percentage = 15;
            discount.Description = "Holiday Discount";
        }

        return discount;
    }
}
Step 2: Register the Custom Strategy
After creating a custom strategy, register it in the pricing engine.
